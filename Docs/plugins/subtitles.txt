Movie Subtitles plugin
----------------

Plugin video.subtitles provides framework that allows individual 
plugins or handlers as I'd like to call them to download subtitles from 
(currently) the follwoing sites:

    http://napiprojekt.pl
    http://opensubtitles.org
    
Subtitles plugin on it's own does not know how to download the sobtitles
from these sites. It needs at least one specialised handler (napiprojekt
or opensubtitles) registered for the download to work.

To enable the plugin and the handlers all one needs to do is to insert 
following lines into the local_config.py:

    plugin.activate('video.subtitles')
    plugin.activate('video.subtitles.napiprojekt')
    plugin.activate('video.subtitles.opensubtitles')

Each handler knows how to get a list available subtitles, download,
decompress and save subtitles.

By default the plugin support following subtitle langauges:

    English

but it can easly configured to support additional langauges:

    SUBS_LANGS = { 'eng': ('English'), 'ger': ('German'), }
        
This will only pull English and German subtitles. in the above dictionary,
key represents the ISO 639-2 language code and value represents 
the language name as used by the plugin to display on OSD, menus etc.

NOTE: napirojekt only supports 2 languages, Polish and English!!!

BTW; Subtitles plugin works with ISO 639-2 language codes.
Vist http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes for details.

User will be presented with the Menu of available Subtitle files in these 
languages and will be allowed to make a choice which Subs to save to 
the local filesystem.

There are some other configuration variables that modify the behaviour
of main Subtitles plugin as well as individual handlers (with default values):

    # Blindly download all subs available, otherwise the 
    # menu with available aubtitles will be presented and choice can be made
    SUBS_AUTOACCEPT = False

    # Override existing subtitle file (if exists)
    SUBS_FORCE_UPDATE = True

    # Backup old file if in update mode above
    SUBS_FORCE_BACKUP = True

    # by default plugin will use follwing filename convention
    # xxx.os.eng where os is the handler's ID (os or np)
    # and eng is the language code of the subtitles.

    # Force use of the subtitle lagnguage code in the filename i.e. xxx.eng.txt
    SUBS_FORCE_LANG_EXT = True,
    
    # Force use of the subtitle handler id in the filename i.e. xxx.os.txt
    SUBS_FORCE_HANDLER_ID = True,
    
    # opensubtitles user agent and domain
    OSUBS_USER_AGENT = "Freevo v1.9"
    OSUBS_DOMAIAN = "http://api.opensubtitles.org/xml-rpc"
    
    # napiprojekt URL and zip password
    NAPI_URL = "http://napiprojekt.pl/unit_napisy/dl.php?l=%s&f=%s&t=%s&v=other&kolejka=false&nick=&pass=&napios=%s"
    NAPI_PWD = "iBlm8NTigvru0Jr0"


If you define SUBS_FORCE_LANG_EXT or SUBS_FORCE_HANDLER_ID make sure
you use sub-fuzziness 1 command line option with mplayer, so it'll use all 
locally available subtitles with extended filenames. 
If you do not define both of those variables, even if you are presented 
with a choice of multiple subfiles available and choose to save them all, 
the last downloaded subfile will be availabe as all others will be overwritten.

As mentioned in the beginning, currently only napiprojekt and opensubtitles 
prbviders are supported. If you know of any other website that provides 
subtitles and an API to download them, let me know please 
(at maciej at urbaniak dot org) and I'll do my best to write a handler 
for this provider. The way the main plugin is designed it should be 
relatively easy to add additional handlers. 

Enjoy!

TODO:
-----
    # By default opensubtitles handler downloads only one set of subs 
    # for a give movie, the one most often downloaded. Often there are more
    # that one set availabe for download, if you want to get a choice of more 
    # that one set, increase the number below (not implemented yet).
    OSUBS_MAX_SUBS = 1

PS/BTW:
-------
As a side effect I have modified original mplayer plugin to display the status
of the subtitles via the show_extended_property slave mode command each time 
the subtitles are changed. 

There seems to be no way to get full name of the subtitle file name as used by
mplayer, get_property returns index, not a file name hance thwarfing the use of 
Freevo's OSD for this. Not an ideal solution and is more of a hack but it 
works for me. 

This behaviour is enabled by default and if you do not like it and prefer 
mplayer to silently change subs then you can disable it by setting following 
in your local_config.py:

    # Prevents freevo from using mplayer's show_ext_prop_text to display
    # current subs and audio track info on the screen
    MPLAYER_USE_OSD_SHOW_PROPS = True
